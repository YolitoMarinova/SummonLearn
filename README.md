Project Idea: Personalized Learning Platform
A small platform where users can create an account, set learning goals, and track their progress on different topics. This app would include features like:

User authentication and profile management.
A dashboard to add, view, and edit goals.
A progress tracker (e.g., percentage complete or badges earned).
Notifications or reminders for users to stay on track.
